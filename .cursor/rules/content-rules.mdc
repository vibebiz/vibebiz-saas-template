- Use common words: "help" not "assist", "buy" not "purchase"
- Avoid jargon and buzzwords
- Keep sentences under 25 words
- Use American English spellings

### Be Direct and Active
- Use active voice: "Configure the API" not "The API should be configured"
- Address readers as "you"
- Avoid hedging words like "please", "simply", or "just"
- Start with verbs for instructions

### Stay Grounded

## Tone by Content Type

| Content Type | Tone | Example |
|-------------|------|---------|
| Instructions | Direct and precise | "Run the test suite before committing changes" |
| Concepts | Clear and educational | "AI models learn from patterns in your data" |
| Troubleshooting | Supportive and practical | "If you encounter this error, first check..." |
| Best practices | Firm but encouraging | "Always validate input data to prevent errors" |

## What to Avoid
- Formal or long words when short ones work
- Passive voice (except where it improves clarity)
- Unnecessary words that don't add meaning
- Assumptions about reader's technical background

## Quick Check
