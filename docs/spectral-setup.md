# How to Set Up Spectral

It appears you're encountering the error:

```text
üôÖ‚Äç error: You need to provide your key (Spectral DSN).
To get your DSN: üåç visit: https://get.spectralops.io/signup
```

This indicates that the Spectral CLI requires a valid DSN (Data Source Name)
to function. Here's how you can set it up:

---

## üîê Step 1: Obtain Your Spectral DSN

1. **Sign Up or Log In**: Visit
   [https://get.spectralops.io/signup](https://get.spectralops.io/signup) to create
   an account or log in.
2. **Retrieve DSN**: After logging in, navigate to **Settings ‚Üí Organization**
   to find your DSN key.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Configure the DSN

You can provide the DSN to Spectral in several ways:

### Option 1: Set as an Environment Variable (Recommended)

For Unix-based systems (Linux/macOS):

```bash
export SPECTRAL_DSN=<your-dsn>
```

For Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:SPECTRAL_DSN = "<your-dsn>"
```

Replace `<your-dsn>` with your actual DSN key.

#### Option 2: Use the `login` Command

Spectral offers a login command to store your DSN:

```bash
spectral login --dsn <your-dsn>
```

This securely saves your DSN for future use.

## üß™ Step 3: Run a Test Scan

To verify that Spectral is set up correctly:

```bash
spectral scan
```

If everything is configured properly, you should see output indicating the scan
results.

## üõ†Ô∏è Additional Tips

- **CI/CD Integration**: When integrating Spectral into CI/CD pipelines (e.g.,
  GitHub Actions, GitLab CI), store the `SPECTRAL_DSN` as a secret or
  environment variable within your pipeline configuration.
- **Inspect Installation Scripts**: As a security best practice, always review
  installation scripts before executing them. Spectral provides installation
  scripts that you can inspect prior to running.
